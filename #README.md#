# My Emacs Customization

This is my personal collection of Emacs Lisp utilities that should be
helpful for some people when customizing their Emacs. It is a personal
collection adapted to my working style. Feel free to modify it
according to your needs.


They are all organized in the file _emacs.init.org_. You can produce a
_emacs.init.el_ file by tangling only the elisp code. To do this, load
the _.org_ file with Emacs and run `M-x org-babel-load-file`. You can
of course edit it before tangling. I assume you are using Emacs24.
